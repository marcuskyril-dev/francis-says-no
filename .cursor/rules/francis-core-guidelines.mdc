# Francis Says No: Core Guardrails

## Product Intent
- Build a renovation budget intelligence dashboard for first-time Singapore homeowners.
- Optimize for clarity, proactive insights, and minimal setup.
- Prefer opinionated defaults over configurability.

## MVP Scope
- Must support project budgets, zones, wishlist items, expenses, budget health, and proactive warnings.
- Keep out of scope: marketplace, contractor matching, AI chat assistant, cross-user benchmarking, mobile app, server-heavy logic.

## Data and Intelligence Rules
- Treat `expenses` as the canonical financial source of truth.
- Compute intelligence from data; do not persist derived intelligence fields.
- Keep business logic out of UI components.

## Architecture Boundaries
- UI components: presentation only.
- Hooks: orchestration and composition.
- Services: data and SDK access.
- Zustand: shared UI state only.
- React Query: async client state.
- No direct SDK usage in UI components.

## Technical Constraints
- Next.js App Router, TypeScript strict, Tailwind + CSS variables, dark mode ready.
- Visual language: white/black/greys, minimal dashboard, border radius `0`.
- Keep code modular, short, and replaceable.
- No `any`, no dead code, no commented-out code.
- Preserve static-export compatibility and free-tier deployability (Vercel/Firebase App Hosting).

## Reusable Guardrail Snippets
- "No business logic in components."
- "No direct SDK usage in UI; use services."
- "Hooks orchestrate; services access data."
- "Compute financial insights, do not store them."
